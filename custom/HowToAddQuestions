This is the format of questions.
The file must be a JSON file. You can copy and paste these templates into the custom.json, just be wary to have a comma (,) between each {}
Question is the question to be asked
Answers is the answer to the question. There can be one or more answers. The game will randomly pick one of the answers. The second example question demonstrates a question with 2 possible answers.  Carrots and broccoli are both vegetables so either answer is exceptable.
Options are the options that are incorrect. There can either be 1, 3 or more options. If theres are more than 3 options as shown in example 2, 3 random options will be selected. Example 4 shows a question with only 1 option.
Difficulty may go form 1-5 and decides the amount of points the player will get for answering correctly.
Categories can be chosen to differentiate questions.

science, misc, geography, history, film, music, language, art, videogames, books, quotes

Note, if a category is not recognized it will be set to "misc". This is case sensitive so be sure to use lowercase in order for the game to pick up the category correctly.
